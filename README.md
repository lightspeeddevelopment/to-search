The [Search extension](https://tour-operator.lsdev.biz/extensions/search/) for the Tour Operators plugin adds robust search functionality to your WordPress Tour Operator site by integrating FacetWP. 

It requires that you also have the FacetWP plugin installed, as that allows for much of the filtering functionality that the plugin uses. The [Tour Operator plugin](https://tour-operator.lsdev.biz/) adds settings to enable or disable facets / filters on archive pages.
